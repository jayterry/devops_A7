## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

The automation process uses a custom workflow file  
located at **`.github/workflows/activity-log.yml`**, which performs:

1. **Fetch recent activity** using `Readme-Workflows/recent-activity@main`
2. **Generate recent commit changelog** from `git log`
3. **Update timestamps** to show the latest update/deployment time
4. **Commit and push** changes to `README.md`
5. **Sync** automatically to GitHub Pages via `index.md`
